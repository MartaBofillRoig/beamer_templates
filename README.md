This template has two beamer colour themes, one according to the university (beamercolorthemeMUW.sty) and the other according to the project (beamercolorthemeEUPEARL.sty). 
In particular, there are the three original MUW footlines and two additional ones. For EU-PEARL, there are two footlines available. Title slides are predefined by style (e.g. \titlepageWhite and \titlepageWhiteEUP for MUW and EUPEARL templates).
